During the last years INFN has worked in several European projects with the aim of establising a European Grid Infrastructure to serve scientists. Recently, Cloud Computing has emerged as an alternative pattern to Grid Computing. Though sometimes they are presented to be competitive, we believe that Grid and Cloud Computing serve different use cases and can work together in improving Distributed Computing Infrastructures (DCIs) offered to scientists in Europe.

These pages collect the work that is being carried on at INFN on the integration between Grid and Cloud services. We are mainly focusing efforts on the following two themes:

* [Dynamic Provisioning of Virtual Worker Nodes](/documentation/vwn_dynamic_provisioning.html)

* [Use of Grid Resourses through Cloud (IaaS) interfaces](/documentation/grid_resources_through_cloud_interfaces.html)
