The Worker Nodes on Demand Service (WNoDeS) is an INFN-developed framework that makes possible to dynamically allocate virtual resources out of a common resource pool.
WNoDeS integrates the Grid and Cloud paradigms exploiting batch system facilities on the same physical resources.
Its main characteristics are:

* Full integration with existing computing resources, scheduling, policing, monitoring and accounting workflow.
* On-demand virtual resource provisioning and VLAN support to dynamically isolate Virtual Machines depending on service type and customer requests.
* Support for users to select and access WNoDeS-based resources through Grid, Cloud interfaces, or also through direct job submissions.

WNoDeS lets local, Grid and cloud computing converge upon Dynamically Provided Virtualized Resources.
It is running in production at the INFN Tier-1 Computing Center.
